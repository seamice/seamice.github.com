No matter trend or seasonality they are all stationary relationships. The residuals will get after removing the trend and seasonality, which are the main research objects. If could get a stationary relationship from the residuals, it would be easier to predict.</p></details><h2 id="references" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#references" aria-hidden="true">#</a> References</h2>',4),m={href:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP05EpN1M58&list=PLYEmLA_7ilZPHis6d-xEGqQ_8Enuv_s32&index=4",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"};function u(p,f){const t=i("ExternalLinkIcon");return n(),s("div",null,[d,e("p",null,[e("a",m,[r("Time Series Analysis"),o(t)])])])}const x=a(h,[["render",u],["__file","ContinueAssessments.html.vue"]]);export{x as default};
