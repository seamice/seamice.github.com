In college we were trying to build a mouse trap car for a racing competition at the end of the semester. Since we had not developed a strategy to complete the project from the beginning us team members were going in different directions to complete the end goal. Once we started getting guidance from our parents (who are engineers) we were able to develop a strategy to design, manufacture, assemble and test the car.

It was turned down because the strategy was focusing on the pros and cons of increased speed of the platform.

When we are given incomplete requirements, or they change multiple times in the design process the tools take longer to design and fabricate. Then there are the requirements that aren't known until the tool goes into use, a platform set that meets all the requirements from the design phase is delivered, then production requests extension platforms be added because there is a wire harness or tubing run that needs to be accessed that they didn't realize previously. Analysis needs to be rerun on the tool and new designs need to be created, if there was a full set of requirements this could be avoided. Then we need to set new rules for use of the platform set so we can still meet our safety requirements while gaining access to the new area and compel production to follow those guidelines to prevent damage to the equipment and personnel.

4c943503763e4e349906eea3ed3c8e86,1927,"I was recently involved with an organizational transformation, which was intended to stimulate change toward proactive activities versus a historical focus on reactive activities. I believe it has not progressed as well as it could have, at least in part due to a non-transparent strategy. To transform an entire organization, it seems there needs to be a right-sized sharing of strategy and information - because an organization typically has many branches that ultimately need to work together. In absence of appropriate understanding of the basis for the attempted changes, the organization may experience lack of support for the changes and also inefficient or incomplete implementation of the changes.","Can you think of a time that you would have had a better experience or outcome if you had known about strategy?

The goal was to improve the reliability and accuracy of the builds, chiefly by targeting to reduce or eliminate costly rework. nnThe age of existing tooling was a primary driving factor,and contributor in the need for rework at critical junctures of the build. I was hired and tasked to lead a tooling design team, compromised of engineers who were both direct employee's and contractors. The volume of engineering work required - redesign of existing tools and design of brand new tools to help stabilize build processes was enormous by any standard (thousands of engineering hours). This included both strictly engineering design hours,stress analysis,tool fabrication and construction.nnIf I had a better handle on strategy, I would have requested immediate restructure of my existing team of designers only, to add other disciplines like stress analysts, tooling construction schedulers, and project managers.

It definitely would have helped unify the project priorities so that everyone was working in the same direction at the same urgency level. nnI was not as focused as I needed to be on the type of resources I was given. I forged ahead without taking the time to do a SWOT analysis, especially identifying inherent weaknesses in the resource assignment in relation to the scope of the work and expected outcomes. nnThis would have helped immensely in trying to meet what was an aggressive schedule.

We knew what the mission of our project was (to create a portable water heater that heated water up to 30 degrees Celsius to destroy bacteria and would be beneficial for those living in rural areas in Africa), our scope of activities, our competitive advantage( making it portable), but we did not have an action program or decision making guidance. As a team, we were able to create a portable solar water heater, but our water heater never heated the water up to 30 degrees Celsius nor did it fully allow us to have a competitive advantage because though it was portable, the material it was made out of, was not material that would be readily available in countries in Africa. Our solar water heater, which was made of copper pipes, would be beneficial in a country like Zambia, which is the biggest producer of copper in Africa, but for a country such as Madagascar, which does not produce copper, it would not be as beneficial. Likewise, our poor strategy led us to have poor decision making guidance. What is considered low cost to us in America could be considered well off to those living in Africa. By not defining low cost relative to the cost of living in rural areas as well as resources available, we were unable to determine a way to continually produce an solar water heater that would be affordable to those living in these certain areas. We would need to invest money in materials, storage, shipping, etc of this water heater which if produced in the US, would completely eliminate the idea of this being a low cost solar water heater for those in rural African areas, which in turn would go against our mission statement and prove our project futile.","Can you think of a time that you would have had a better experience or outcome if you had known about strategy?

4c943503763e4e349906eea3ed3c8e86,6061,"When I first went to work at the State Department, I was on a team where communication did not flow down at all from leadership so no one ever really had a full grasp of our strategy - it all felt highly whimsical. This often seemed by design, and I found it challenging to ever really understand what my role was, and what our end goal was for designing events and executing them. I was only allowed access to small pieces or parts of a whole. It was frustrating and demoralizing and moreover, I felt a sense from leadership that there was a lack of trust in the members of the team. As a result, many of our events and engagements lacked cohesion or they were planned at the very last minute once everyone was finally read into things. It meant we were under-prepared and overworked. nnIf communication had been stronger at the outset about the end goals and objectives, everyone would have worked in a more collaborative manner and been less protective of their own small piece of the work. It would have raised morale and made team members more inclined to help one another to see things through to the end. At a certain point, we had a leadership change on my smaller team and I was given the opportunity to run one of our programs. I used the experience of poor leadership to consciously communicate, demonstrate support of the people working on my team and as a result, our events were stronger, better run and less stressful for all involved.

As I create supply chain strategy for our division, it is important that I keep these individual missions/visions in mind.  As a result, an improvement to my personal development plan will consist of me taking the time to not only read through each facilities mission statement, but talk with employees to ensure that I clearly understand it.  This broaden perspective will really help to ensure that the initiatives the team puts forth will not only be well thought out, but ensure that will align with the divisions differing organizational cultures.nnDealing with Things Outside of Your Control – The Fabrication business I support is often subjected to the ebbs and flows of each airplane program (as we support each Commercial aircraft within Boeing).  If demand increases/decreases, we much adjust our supply chain strategy accordingly.  Unforeseen circumstances (either within the volatile marketplace or with unstable suppliers) can often throw curveballs at our organization; causing us to constantly react to differencing situations.  Part of my team’s development plan will be to try and account for these circumstances that are outside of our control through setting up efforts that can help mitigate risk.  This can be through a careful analysis of safety stock inventory or even looking at readiness assessments of our suppliers.

As maintainers, it is important that we keep a broad view by understanding all possibilities. We deal with ambiguity by receiving all the potential work of the day ad strategically dealing with which tasks should be accomplished first. We sometimes have to deal with that we don't have control over, such as weather issues and we must learn what to do if those issues occur. Our desire to win is what drives us to complete tasks and ensure to accept all other attributes with no concern.  I believe a lot of leaders that make the decisions for us have a lack of dealing with ambiguity though. they tend to focus on the main tasks and not really prepare for it. They also don't have a broad view of understanding and tend to not prepare for what they don't ave control over. I believe if pre-planning was done right by them, we would have slow downs.

We created our design and quickly realized that the materials and fabrication processes we had selected were quite difficult in terms of tolerances, and requirements. Our leveraged knowledge of the supplier also warned us that this may cause plenty of issues and defects and may end up costing a substantial cost more than what was budgeted. Also, we were expecting added lead time that would not meet our requirements.nnnUsing strategic thinking, we got creative and redesigned portions of the hardware to lessen the threats.

We had to strategically plan a very solid and clear path forward with the necessary quality checks and milestones for the vendor to ensure a timely and quality driven delivery.nnnWhat I would have liked to improve would have been starting off the design from a broader perspective and keeping that perspective throughout the entire process.

I completed a significant amount of research on our historic contracts, studied the strengths and weaknesses of each, and learned that there was a significant amount of risks (threats) with making any changes to the current strategy as some Engineering teams rely heavily on specific equipment from specific suppliers, and without them various production lines could be impacted.nAfter getting a good understanding of the background, I focused in on my opportunities and learned that many of the weaknesses (lost parts, over paying for rentals that could be returned, etc.) could be resolved by implementing an RFID system, and many of the strengths (good relationships with suppliers, familiarity with equipment, etc.) could still be maintained so long as the right constraints were included within the contract language. For example, a comprehensive list of every single piece of equipment, rental rates by hour/day/month, and requirements to document the details of every transaction in a shared database, which included instructions on how to use all parts. I also proposed to leadership that instead of many small contracts with a wide list of suppliers, we create one large contract with one supplier (using the RFID technology & the well-defined terms and conditions) so that we had better control over the contract and what rentals are ordered against it. nMy strategy was somewhat successful; the RFID technology & improved contract terminology was implemented. However, the idea to contract with only one supplier was rejected as the risk of impacting the production line was too high. I think if I focused more on working with Engineering teams to better understand their concerns (threats), I could have proposed a strategy that was more appealing to both a supplier management organization and an engineering organization. nThe areas where I might be able to lead by building new strengths within my own group would be regarding training and onboarding new employees. There is so much “tribal knowledge” within our organization and we rely heavily on word of mouth for training. If we could somehow document all that knowledge and formalize the onboarding process, it would be using our strengths to create a new and more efficient way to train our new employees. n","When in your career did you have an opportunity to practice strategic planning and contribute to emergent strategy?

The organization wanted to make the move to develop their engineers with industry knowledge and take on key leadership roles in the organization.  I was able to utilize connections my one team member had made over his 30 years in the industry to bring in vendors and engineering support to trial experimental technologies and other development opportunities.  The other engineers on the team had a strong desire and the passion to work on this research on top of their baseline load of supporting production functions.  This not only provided exceptional experience for the younger inexperience engineers, but it also provided our organization with key rights to the technology in development since our facility and resources were used in the research and testing phases.  It was a very positive for the engineers who have now moved onto roles such as plant manager, director, and lead engineer.

While the team had been working in 2 week sprints and had regular cadence for sprint planning, system demos and retrospectives, they had challenges with longer-lead planning and meeting commitments. As part of the strategic planning, I created a charter for our first Program Increment Planning workshop to identify the scope, objectives, attendees and logistics, created a schedule including the prerequisite work and workshop execution, and hosted the workshop via virtual collaboration sessions across multiple sites.nAs the team had not previously had experience with this type of workshop, and we were not afforded the opportunity of co-location, it was at times difficult to complete the workshop objectives. However the end result was a committed list of prioritized content (i.e. features/user stories) and estimates that would guide the development work for the next quarter.  Having this structured approach has given the team clear visibility of the business priorities and ownership of the committed content, allowing them to focus & finish on work and demonstrate ability to deliver on commitments.

I was able to voice my observations, in noting that automating projects that touch frequently-changing, 3rd party websites led to less-stable robots. This helped shape our team's strategy, as now, we generally aim to avoid projects that involve interacting with 3rd party websites, which leads to greater stability and less maintenance in our robotic processes. nnThere is an opportunity for me to lead by building new strengths for our team by completing surface automation training.

Many companies started to  adopt Robotics Process Automation  and few were industry leaders. We had to strategically think and plan what would change and what would not change as a result of implementing this. For example RPA would trigger process changes and reduce cycle time and will create more bandwidth to do value added jobs learning and collaboration but will not change the final outcome of the Job.nI was managing this project and we conducted a POC and comparative study on the available software’s in the market and finally decided to implement one. We also identified that RPA required minimum development experience as a result we identified internal developers and trained them to be future developers.  We were very successful with our approach and it yielded positive results and cost savings for the business.nnIn my current group we have architects with diverse experience and backgrounds.
